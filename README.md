# Motivation letter code

I made the very basic version of this to apply for Makers.
I get the idea for this project from their word number restriction in the fill out form.
The character printer function, and the cipher were added later on, because my friend thought 'my code' wasn't very impressive. ðŸ˜° 
In the end, I never got the chance to use this project again. ðŸ˜…

## To see my motivation letter

Run `main.rb`.

```sh
ruby main.rb
```

## Make your own printer array 

1. Go the the lib folder, if you are not there already.

```sh

2. Open the `mapper.rb` in your editor.
3. Change the `str` variable to your choice
4. Run the `mapper.rb`.

```sh
ruby mapper.rb
```
5. Copy the array.

## Make your own word hash 

1. Go the the lib folder, if you are not there already.

```sh
cd ./lib
```

2. Open the `word_maker.rb` in your editor.
